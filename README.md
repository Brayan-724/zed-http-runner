# http extension for Zed

## Overview
The `zed-http` extension provides robust syntax highlighting for `.http` files in the Zed editor, enhancing the development and testing of HTTP requests directly within the editor. This extension aims to replicate and eventually expand upon the functionality similar to the HTTP request capabilities seen in JetBrains editors, as described [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec/blob/master/spec.md).

## Features
- Syntax highlighting for HTTP methods, headers, URLs, and bodies.
- Supports standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS.
- Future updates will hopefully include the ability to make HTTP requests directly from the editor.
